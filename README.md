# BluetoothTimer
Its main functionality is to allow users to set a timer to automatically disable the Bluetooth adapter on their device.\
Once the preset time elapsed, the app will turn off Bluetooth.\
This app provides convenience by automating the Bluetooth disabling process.\
To complete this project I used Android Studio, Java, Android Bluetooth API.\
Requires user permissions:\
"android.permission.BLUETOOTH"\
"android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"\
"android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"\
"android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN
